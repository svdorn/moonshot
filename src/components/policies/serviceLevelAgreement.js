                    <br/><br/> Effective Starting: 6/10/2018

                    <br/><br/> The Moonshot Insights Service Level Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you and Moonshot Learning, Inc. (“Moonshot Insights” or “We” or “Company”). If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of your company, then “Customer” or “you” or “customer’s company” means your company and you are binding your company to this Agreement. By accessing the Services on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company. Moonshot Insights may modify this Agreement from time to time, subject to the terms in section 10.
By clicking on the “I agree” (or similar button) that is presented to you at the time of your Order, or by using or accessing Moonshot Insights products, you indicate your assent to be bound by this Agreement.

                    <br/><br/> <b>A.	Moonshot Insights Services</b>

                    <br/><br/> Moonshot Insights offers software-as-a-service solutions to provide candidate assessments for given positions. Predictions offered by Moonshot Insights should be seen as predictions and not statements of fact.

                    <br/><br/> <b>B. 	Service Fees</b>

                    <br/><br/> Moonshot Insights’ fees are based on “active position evaluations” or a position (e.g. Business Analyst) at a customer’s company that has a Moonshot Insights evaluation to assess candidates for that position and is under subscription term. The first active position evaluation for customers is free. Each additional active position evaluation is subject to the following subscription terms:
                    <br/>(1)     Free subscription for your first active position evaluation.
                    <br/>(2)     $79 for an annual subscription to one active position evaluation.
                    <br/>(3)     $89 for a six-month subscription to one active position evaluation.
                    <br/>(4)     $99 for a three-month subscription to one active position evaluation.
                    <br/>You can have multiple types of subscriptions concurrently and multiple active position evaluations concurrently.

                    <br/><br/> <b>C. 	Service Change Requests</b>

                    <br/><br/> You can request that one of your active position evaluations be changed to another position for any reason (e.g. change your Business Analyst evaluation under a six-month subscription to a Content Marketer evaluation for the remainder of the subscription term for the previous position). To submit a request, you must email support@moonshotinsights.io outlining your current active position under a specific subscription term and your proposed change to a new position under the same subscription. You cannot submit a change request for your free subscription for your first active position evaluation. We can, in our sole discretion, deny any request by a customer to change the position that is being evaluated for that subscription term. If we accept the change request, we have thirty [30] business days from the date of our express written acceptance to change the evaluation to the proposed position. As a note, the content of the evaluation will be active within thirty [30] business days of express written consent of the change; this does not guarantee that the predictions will be active for the new position within that period as ample data is necessary to generate predictions for new positions. Importantly, the subscription term does not stall in the process of service change requests to switch positions for an active evaluation subscription (e.g. an annual subscription maintains the same expiration date as without a service change request). You can always purchase another subscription term to initiate a new position.

                    <br/><br/> <b>6.    WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER</b>

                    <br/><br/> Moonshot Insights shall use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the Services in a manner which minimizes errors and interruptions in the Services.  Services may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or for unscheduled emergency maintenance, either by Moonshot Insights or by third-party providers, or because of other causes beyond Moonshot Insights’ reasonable control, but Moonshot Insights shall use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in writing or by e-mail of any scheduled service disruption.  However, MOONSHOT INSIGHTS does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error free; nor does it make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from use of the Services.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND MOONSHOT INSIGHTS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

                    <br/><br/> <b>7.    INDEMNITY</b>

                    <br/><br/> Moonshot Insights shall hold Customer harmless from liability to third parties resulting from infringement by the Service of any United States patent or any copyright or misappropriation of any trade secret, provided Moonshot Insights is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; Moonshot Insights will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.  The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the Service (i) not supplied by Moonshot Insights, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with Customer specifications, (iii) that are modified after delivery by Moonshot Insights, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) where Customer’s use of the Service is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement.  If, due to a claim of infringement, the Services are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by Moonshot Insights to be infringing, Moonshot Insights may, at its option and expense (a) replace or modify the Service to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (b) obtain for Customer a license to continue using the Service, or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this Agreement and Customer’s rights hereunder and provide Customer a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the Service.

                    <br/><br/> <b>8.    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>

                    <br/><br/> NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PERSON, MOONSHOT INSIGHTS AND ITS SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OR FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (C) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND MOONHSOT INSIGHTS’ REASONABLE CONTROL; OR (D) FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO COMPANY FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                    <br/><br/> <b>9.    MISCELLANEOUS</b>

                    <br/><br/> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with Moonshot Insights’ prior written consent.  Moonshot Insights may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without consent.  This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind Moonshot Insights in any respect whatsoever.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.  All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

                    <br/><br/><b>10.    CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT</b>

                    <br/><br/>We may update or modify this Agreement from time to time. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical contact you designate in the applicable Order, or in the Product itself). If we modify the Agreement during your License Term or Subscription Term, the modified version will be effective upon your next renewal of a Subscription Term, as applicable. In this case, if you object to the updated Agreement, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose not to renew, including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. With respect to No-Charge Products, accepting the updated Agreement is required for you to continue using the No-Charge Products. You may be required to click through the updated Agreement to show your acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Agreement after it becomes effective, you will no longer have a right to use No-Charge Products. For the avoidance of doubt, any Order is subject to the version of the Agreement in effect at the time of the Order.
