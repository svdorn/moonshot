                    <br/><br/><b>3. Moonshot Rights and Obligations</b>

                    <br/><br/>3.1. We have the right to monitor your site at any time to determine if you are following the terms
                    and conditions of this Agreement. We may notify you of any changes to your site that we feel should be made,
                    or to make sure that your links to our web site are appropriate and to notify further you of any changes that
                    we feel should be made. If you do not make the changes to your site that we feel are necessary, we reserve the
                    right to terminate your participation in the Moonshot Affiliate Program.
                    <br/><br/>3.2. Moonshot reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and your participation in the Moonshot
                    Affiliate Program immediately and without notice to you should you commit fraud in your use of the Moonshot
                    Affiliate Program or should you abuse this program in any way. If such fraud or abuse is detected, Moonshot
                    shall not be liable to you for any commissions for such fraudulent sales.
                    <br/><br/>3.3. This Agreement will begin upon our acceptance of your Affiliate request, and will continue unless
                    terminated hereunder.


                    <br/><br/><b>4. Termination</b>

                    <br/><br/>Either you or we may end this Agreement AT ANY TIME, with or without cause, by giving the other party
                    written notice. Written notice can be in the form of mail, email or fax. In addition, this Agreement will terminate
                    immediately upon any breach of this Agreement by you.

                    <br/><br/><b>5. Modification</b>

                    <br/><br/>We may modify any of the terms and conditions in this Agreement at any time at our sole discretion. In
                    such event, you will be notified by email. Modifications may include, but are not limited to, changes in the payment
                    procedures and Moonshot{"'"}s Affiliate Program rules. If any modification is unacceptable to you, your only option
                    is to end this Agreement. Your continued participation in Moonshot{"'"}s Affiliate Program following the posting of
                    the change notice or new Agreement on our site will indicate your agreement to the changes.

                    <br/><br/><b>6. Payment</b>

                    <br/><br/>Moonshot will pay you the proper fees and commission through PayPal. You must provide your PayPal account
                    to receive the funds.

                    <br/><br/><b>7. Affiliate Account Updates</b>

                    <br/><br/>To receive an update on your affiliate activity, you can email support@moonshotlearning.org requesting an update.


                    <br/><br/><b>8. Promotion Restrictions</b>

                    <br/><br/>8.1. You are free to promote your own web sites, but naturally any promotion that mentions Moonshot could
                    be perceived by the public or the press as a joint effort. You should know that certain forms of advertising are always
                    prohibited by Moonshot. For example, advertising commonly referred to as "spamming" is unacceptable to us and could
                    cause damage to our name. Other generally prohibited forms of advertising include the use of unsolicited commercial
                    email (UCE), postings to non-commercial newsgroups and cross-posting to multiple newsgroups at once. In addition, you
                    may not advertise in any way that effectively conceals or misrepresents your identity, your domain name, or your return
                    email address. You may use mailings to customers to promote Moonshot so long as the recipient is already a customer or
                    subscriber of your services or web site, and recipients have the option to remove themselves from future mailings. Also,
                    you may post to newsgroups to promote Moonshot so long as the news group specifically welcomes commercial messages. At
                    all times, you must clearly represent yourself and your web sites as independent from Moonshot. If it comes to our attention
                    that you are spamming, we will consider that cause for immediate termination of this Agreement and your participation
                    in the Moonshot Affiliate Program. Any pending balances owed to you will not be paid if your account is terminated due
                    to such unacceptable advertising or solicitation.

                    <br/><br/>8.2. Affiliates that among other keywords or exclusively bid in their Pay-Per-Click campaigns on keywords
                    such as moonshotinsights.io, Moonshot, www.moonshot, www.moonshotinsights.io, and/or any misspellings or similar
                    alterations of these – be it separately or in combination with other keywords – and do not direct the traffic from such
                    campaigns to their own website prior to re-directing it to ours, will be considered trademark violators, and will be banned
                    from Moonshot’s Affiliate Program. We will do everything possible to contact the affiliate prior to the ban. However, we
                    reserve the right to expel any trademark violator from our affiliate program without prior notice, and on the first
                    occurrence of such PPC bidding behavior.

                    <br/><br/>8.3. Affiliates are not prohibited from keying in prospect’s information into the lead form as long as the prospects’
                    information is real and true, and these are valid leads (i.e. sincerely interested in Moonshot’s service).

                    <br/><br/>8.4. Affiliate shall not transmit any so-called “interstitials,” “Parasiteware™,” “Parasitic Marketing,”
                    “Shopping Assistance Application,” “Toolbar Installations and/or Add-ons,” “Shopping Wallets” or “deceptive pop-ups and/or
                    pop-unders” to consumers from the time the consumer clicks on a qualifying link until such time as the consumer has fully
                    exited Moonshot’s site (i.e., no page from our site or any Moonshot’s content or branding is visible on the end-user’s screen).
                    As used herein a. “Parasiteware™” and “Parasitic Marketing” shall mean an application that (a) through accidental or direct
                    intent causes the overwriting of affiliate and non affiliate commission tracking cookies through any other means than a
                    customer initiated click on a qualifying link on a web page or email; (b) intercepts searches to redirect traffic through
                    an installed software, thereby causing, pop ups, commission tracking cookies to be put in place or other commission tracking
                    cookies to be overwritten where a user would under normal circumstances have arrived at the same destination through the
                    results given by the search (search engines being, but not limited to, Google, MSN, Yahoo, Overture, AltaVista, Hotbot and
                    similar search or directory engines); (c) set commission tracking cookies through loading of Moonshot site in IFrames,
                    hidden links and automatic pop ups that open moonshotinsights.io’s site; (d) targets text on web sites, other than those
                    web sites 100% owned by the application owner, for the purpose of contextual marketing; (e) removes, replaces or blocks
                    the visibility of Affiliate banners with any other banners, other than those that are on web sites 100% owned by the owner
                    of the application.


                    <br/><br/><b>9. Grant of Licenses</b>

                    <br/><br/>9.1. We grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to (i) access our site through HTML links

                    interest to its respective rights and no right, title, or interest is transferred to the other.
