                    their skills to, and connect with, employers (“Employers”) looking to hire
                    Applicants in various areas of expertise. Applicants and Employers
                    (collectively, “Users”) connect through Employer sponsored courses designed
                    to test an Applicant’s skills in a specialized area (“Pathways”).
