                <br/><br/> <b>Intellectual Property</b>

                <br/><br/> The Site and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Moonshot and are

                <br/><br/> <b>Warranty Disclaimer</b>

                <br/><br/> Moonshot does not guarantee that the information provided on our website is accurate,

                incentive, the candidate must be interviewed directly by one of Moonshot’s hiring partners for the $100
                to apply. Any and all engagements by the candidate to initiate the interview outside of Moonshot
                nullifies the $100 if you interview incentive. Each user can receive the $100 incentive once.
